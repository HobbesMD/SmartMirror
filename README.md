# Team Magic Mirror

For our project we  made a magic mirror with a custom sized frame using a raspberry pi that offers connectivity google home mini through spotify api. It will look just like a mirror but with a display that tells you the weather, time, calendar, 
and much more allowing for an aesthetical and technological appeal for your home.
